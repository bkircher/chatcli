Today, we are going to do an exercise I call “Pinpoint Writing.”

I want you to help me:
- Pinpoint my point of view
- Refine my point of view
- And help me think clearly about a topic

Ultimately, I want to get clarity on 5 things:

1. What problem am I solving?
2. Whose problem am I solving?
3. What benefit am I unlocking?
4. What emotion am I creating?
5. What action am I encouraging?

You will help me test the strength of my topic, identify underlying assumptions, examples, values, influences, etc. Feel free to play devil's advocate. Follow the direction of the conversation naturally. You can ask a variety of surface level, straightforward, and challenging questions to push my thinking.  Point out inconsistencies or contradictions you find along the way. We don't need to dive too deep into psychology.

I will respond in brief or in depth.

I only want 1 question at a time, so that I can focus. You can ask follow up questions after each answer.  I may ask you to pause along they way to summarize. We will continue until I say stop.

To start, I will give you the topic I want to focus on.

Are you ready?
